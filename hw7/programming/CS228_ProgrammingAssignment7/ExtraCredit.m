% ExtraCredit.m
% If you choose to do the extra credit portion of this assignment, you
% should do two things:
% 1) Call the function SaveECPredictions(yourPredictions).
%      `yourPredictions' should be an 80x3 matrix where
%      yourPredictions(i,j) is the predicted value (1-26) of the j'th
%      character in the i'th word. That is, the predicted value for
%      testData(i).y(j).
% 2) Copy and paste the contents of any new files you have written into
%    this file. The `submit' script needs to know the filenames in advance
%    when we collect your code, but we want to allow you to structure your
%    code any way you like. By copying those new files into this file, we
%    will collect this file and have your code.
